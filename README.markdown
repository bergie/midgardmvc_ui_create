Web content editing tool for Midgard MVC, using the innovative Aloha WYSIWYG editor

**Update**: the user interface (JavaScript) parts of Midgard Create have now been extracted to their own repository and are being refactored to be generic so that they can be used also outside Midgard context. See more in the [new Create repository](https://github.com/bergie/create)
